# Projects

## `neural_networks`
This mini-project has [the simplest implementation of a recurrent neural network](../neural_networks/min-char-rnn.py) described [here](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).  Run it and wait long enough, and you'll see some not-entirely-unreasonable randomly-generated Bible-like text (reasonable formatting in 10k iterations, some reasonable sentence structure in 50k iterations, and so on).  Highly recommended.

## `numpy_examples`
The `numpy` Python library works a lot like matrices in Matlab.  The [`compute_and_plot`](../numpy_examples/compute_and_plot.py) script shows a brief example of how to work with 1D matrices.
